## Introduction to random processes and simulation models based on stochastic differential equations
The project consists of two parts:
1. Simulation of the ruble and the dollar interest rate using the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model and simulation of the ruble to dollar exchange rate using the Foreign-Exchange model. To construct simulations, stohastic differential equation with coefficients is numerically solved. Coefficients are estimated using linear regression on historical data
2. Implemented a function for calculating the cost of range accrual
